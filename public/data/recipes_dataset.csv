Salt and pepper to taste
3 tablespoons finely chopped coriander (optional)
Instructions
Heat the oil in a large pan or wok over a medium-high heat. When hot and bubbly, add the mustard seeds. When the mustard seeds begin to crackle, stir in the cinnamon stick, leeks, curry leaves, pandan leaves and lemongrass.
Stir these ingredients around in the oil for about 30 seconds
Now stir in the chopped onions and fry for about 5 minutes or until turning soft and translucent. Then stir in the garlic and ginger paste along with the chopped chillies.
Continue frying and stirring for another 30 seconds and then stir in the ground spices.
Add the diced chicken and fry to brown for a couple of minutes and then add the coconut milk. You want the chicken to be just covered with liquid, so add a little water or chicken stock if needed. Add the kokum berries if using.
Bring this to a simmer and cover the pan to continue simmering for about 10 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
Remove the lid and cook the sauce down to your preferred consistency.
If you haven't added kokum, add the tamarind concentrate and stir it into the sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Try it and adjust the spicing to taste. You can also add a little more tamarind or lemon juice if you prefer a more sour flavour.

Spiced red lentil curry
▢150 g red lentils ¾ cup
▢600 mL water 2.5 cups
▢½ tsp sea salt
▢2 – 3 green chili use jalapeno for a mild version, OR de-seed the green chili before using. OR omit for a very mild version (but I do recommend some green chili at least).
▢¼ yellow onion sliced
▢1 garlic clove minced
▢½ tsp sugar
▢120 – 180 mL canned coconut milk ½ – ¾ cup, full fat preferably.
Spice mix for the curry
▢¼ tsp ground turmeric
▢½ tsp ground cinnamon
▢½ tsp ground cumin
▢¼ tsp ground coriander
▢¼ tsp Kashmiri chili or cayenne pepper use less if you prefer (we use 1 tsp as we do like it spicier).
▢⅛ tsp hing / asafoetida optional, but recommended
▢8 fenugreek seeds ground, optional
For tempering
▢2 – 3 tbsp vegetable oil or coconut oil
▢¼ onion very thinly sliced
▢1 dried red chili adjust to suit your spice tolerance, or use more if you like more heat.
▢½ tsp black mustard seeds
▢½ tsp cumin seeds
▢6 – 10 curry leaves
▢¼ cup cilantro chopped
▢Lime for lime juice, optional
Instructions:
Spiced red lentil curry
Place the lentils in a fine sieve or colander. Wash the lentils very well until the water runs clear.
150 g red lentils

In a medium pot (about 3 qt), add the washed lentils, water, salt, green chili, onion, minced garlic, sugar, and the spice mix. Make sure the fenugreek seeds are ground before you add it, otherwise it'll be bitter if you bite into whole seeds.
150 g red lentils,600 mL water,½ tsp sea salt,2 – 3 green chili,¼ yellow onion,1 garlic clove,½ tsp sugar,¼ tsp ground turmeric,½ tsp ground cinnamon,½ tsp ground cumin,¼ tsp ground coriander,¼ tsp Kashmiri chili or cayenne pepper,⅛ tsp hing / asafoetida,8 fenugreek seeds

Over medium high heat, bring the water to a boil. Then lower the heat and simmer the red lentils for about 10 – 15 minutes until the lentils are just cooked through. You can have the pot partially covered or uncovered for this, but do add some hot water if too much water evaporates. I prefer to have the lentil curry partially covered.
The longer the red lentils are simmered, the more they will lose their shape. If you prefer your red lentils to better hold their shape, simmer only until the lentils are mostly cooked through. If you prefer a creamier texture, you can allow the lentils to simmer until fully cooked through.
When the lentils have simmered, stir in the coconut milk. You can also add a little extra water to get the consistency you like. I like my red lentil curry to be creamy, but have a looser texture (between a thick curry and soup).
120 – 180 mL canned coconut milk
Heat the dhal while stirring until it starts to simmer, and then allow to simmer for about 2 minutes. Taste and adjust salt to your taste.
The curry can be served as is at this point, with some chopped cilantro on top and a squeeze of lime juice. But you can also temper the curry (instructions below) for a big flavor boost!
Tempering dhal curry
Break the dried chili in half, or into larger pieces. You can use more than one for a spicier curry.
1 dried red chili
Heat the oil over medium heat in a small pot.
2 – 3 tbsp vegetable oil
When the oil starts to heat up, add the thinly sliced onions. Sauté to sweat the onions while heating the oil.
¼ onion
When the onions start to turn a light golden color, add the mustard seeds and cumin. Keep stirring the mixture until the mustard seeds start to pop, and the onions are more golden in color.
½ tsp black mustard seeds,½ tsp cumin seeds
When the mustard seeds start popping, add the dried chili and curry leaves, and mix for about 30 seconds to let the curry leaves and chili toast. But do NOT let them burn.
6 – 10 curry leaves,1 dried red chili
Immediately add these tempered spices to the hot lentil curry, and stir in to mix.
The dhal curry is now ready to be served.
OPTIONAL – You can add about 100 g of leafy greens while heating the lentil curry until the greens wilt and mix into the curry. This will take a further 2 – 4 minutes, depending on how much you add. Spinach is common and a favorite.
Before serving, stir in chopped cilantro (or simply sprinkle some on top), along with a squeeze of lime juice.
¼ cup cilantro,Lime
Tips & Tricks
Storage
This dhal curry can be made ahead of time, and will in fact taste better the next day. However, the curry will thicken the longer it’s stored, so you may need to add a little extra liquid as you reheat the curry. 
Dhal curry will last in the fridge for about 4 days, and in the freezer for up to 6 months. 
If you’re reheating this curry from frozen, make sure to reheat the curry at about 50% power (in your microwave) for a longer time until the curry thaws.
Then you can reheat at 100% power until it’s properly heated. This ensures more even reheating of the lentils.
Alternatively, you can allow the dal curry to thaw in the fridge for 12 – 24 hours, and then reheat in the microwave or on the stove.",Sri Lankan Dhal Curry,Curries,"Kirata(Using Coconut Milk),Spicy Flavor",10-20,"Lunch,Breakfast,Dinner",Western,Healthy

Cut the stem off of the cauliflower, but do not discard it. Also remove the leaves around the cauliflower (IF you got one with leaves), and set aside.

Cut the head of the cauliflower into florets. The florets should be bite-sized and also evenly-sized if possible. Rinse and drain, and set aside.

Take the stem of the cauliflower and trim the bottom if it’s dried out. If the stem is very tough, use a peeler or knife to remove the outer skin of the cauliflower stem. Cut the stem into 1 inch pieces, and then slice these pieces. They don’t have to be too thin, but shouldn’t be too thick either. Take the leaves of the cauliflower and cut them into long strips. Wash these separately and set aside.                                      Prepare the rest of the spices next. Slice or dice the onions. Slice the garlic and/or ginger as well. Finally, measure out the other spices as well and keep them all together, along with the coconut milk.                          Heat some oil (coconut oil or a neutral tasting oil) in a pot, over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds. Stir the mustard seeds around until you start to hear them pop. Add the curry leaves and stir fry for just a few seconds. Add the onions, garlic, chili, rampe, and other spices, and saute until the onions soften.                                                                                                                                             Cooking the cauliflower.
Add the cauliflower florets and the cut up stem into the pot. Mix until the cauliflower is coated in the spice mix, and then add a little salt as well. Saute the cauliflower for about 5 – 10 minutes until the cauliflower is just starting to soften. Add the cauliflower greens, and then the coconut milk (and water, if using).

Bring the coconut milk to a boil, then lower the heat and let it simmer for about 10 – 15 minutes. Or a minimum of 10 minutes, until the cauliflower is soft. I like to uncover the pot and let the creamy cauliflower curry simmer, so that the gravy has a chance to concentrate and thicken, making it even more creamy and flavorful. But if you’d like more gravy, you can close the lid and let it simmer as well. If you need to, add a little more water to get the desired consistency.

Chop the onions and slice the green and red chili peppers. Remove the seeds if you prefer less heat in your apple curry.                                               Wash and cut apples into quarters. Do not remove seeds or the core. Halve the quarters length-wise for thinner slices or across for chunkier pieces.
Heat the oil over medium heat in a non-stick saucepan or skillet.
Add the onions, bay leaves, green and red chili pepper and mustard seeds, and saute for a few minutes till onions are softened.                             Add the Sri Lankan curry powder, turmeric and chili powder and mix for about 30 seconds, just until you start to smell the spices.
Add the sliced/quartered apples, garlic, salt and sugar and cook on medium high heat for a few minutes while gently coating the apples all over with the spices.
Cook the apples for about 10 minutes – uncovered, stirring occasionally. The apples will start to soften slightly.
Add the coconut milk and water/apple cider and stir through with the apples. Return to the stove for another 5 – 10 minutes covered, until the apples soften – PLEASE SEE NOTE.
Taste and season with more salt if desired.
Carefully stir through to coat the apples with the sauce/gravy – since the apples have softened and you don’t want them to break up (add more water if you like more sauce – but I recommend a thicker sauce).
Tips & Tricks
NOTE – cook the apples for only about 5 minutes if you prefer slightly firmer apples that still have a good bite to it. Cook them up to 8 minutes if you prefer softer apples in your curry. I love apples that are very soft, but they are firmer in traditional Sri Lankan apple curries.

This curry is heavy on coconut milk, since it adds creaminess to the curry. For best results, use regular full-fat coconut milk. But if you must, you can use light coconut milk too. I don’t typically use light coconut milk since it doesn’t have as much flavor as regular full fat coconut milk.

Toasted desiccated coconut
Here’s a pro tip that makes this delicious pumpkin curry recipe different from all the other pumpkin curries out there, and truly elevates this dish.

The addition of toasted, desiccated coconut imparts a lovely toasty, smoky flavor! This is an optional step, but it’s a very popular technique for some Sri Lankan curries. 

The unsweetened desiccated coconut is toasted in a non-stick pan until it starts to turn golden brown in color and is toasted. This is then ground into a powder and added to the curry.

It not only adds a lovely smoky flavor, but also helps to thicken the curry.                                                                                                                                                  How to make pumpkin curry
How to cut the pumpkin into pieces
Since Jamaican pumpkin is large, I usually only buy pieces that have already been cut.

Whichever pumpkin you use, you need to scoop out the pumpkin seeds in the center. Then you can cut the pumpkin into pieces.

With large pumpkins, cut them into wedges that are about 2 inches in width on the skin side. Then cut each wedge into pieces that are about 1 inch thick. You can cut each piece in half for 1 x 1 inch pieces, or keep them at 2 x 1 inch as well.

Butternut squash can be prepped by first halving them and then removing the seeds. Then lay them cut side down, and cut pieces that are about 1 x 2 inches.                                                                                                 Prepare all the other ingredients
I like to keep the garlic cloves whole. This is because they soften in the curry, and my husband loves eating softened whole garlic cloves. That way the curry gets plenty of garlic flavor, and my husband gets to eat “curried” garlic cloves. Win win.

This curry works best with a generous amount of garlic. If you’re especially averse to it, then you can reduce it, but I do highly recommend being generous with the garlic.

You can find my Sri Lankan curry powder recipe here.

Toast the unsweetened desiccated coconut before you start cooking OR while the pumpkin curry is cooking. You will be adding this only at the end.                                                                                                                                  Start cooking
Once you have everything prepped, cooking this Sri Lankan pumpkin curry is easy, and it doesn’t take much time.

In a large pot, heat some oil (you can use any kind of cooking oil) over medium heat. Add the onions and start to soften them in the pot. Add the garlic and curry leaves at the same time. This allows the base of the curry to develop.

When the onions are translucent, add the spices (including the Sri Lankan curry powder), and stir until they toast ever so slightly, so you can smell all the flavors of the spices.

Add the pumpkin and coconut milk (and some salt and a little sugar), and stir to combine. Let it simmer in the curry sauce over medium or medium – high heat (with the lid off). Top off with water only if too much of the coconut milk evaporates.                                                                  The curry is done when the pumpkin is tender. You can add more water if you’d like the curry sauce to be less thick. But take care when stirring the curry, as you don’t want to crush the soft pumpkin pieces.

PRO TIP – Instead of stirring the curry, you can swirl the pot to get the spices to mix with the liquid. If you do need to move the pumpkin around, gently move or flip the pumpkin pieces instead.

When the pumpkin curry is almost done, sprinkle in the ground toasted coconut, and very gently fold it in. You can also gently shake the pot to distribute the ground coconut in the sauce.

Reduce the heat to a simmer, and let it cook covered, for about 5 minutes.
Uncover and cook for a further 5 - 10 minutes while stirring frequently, until the beetroot is cooked to al dente (i.e. cooked through but not soggy). The cook time will vary depending on the thickness and sizes of the beetroot.
If the liquid is evaporating too quickly, you can add more water or coconut milk.
Taste and add more salt if necessary. 
Serve with cooked rice.
Tips & Tricks
For beginners - Without cutting the beetroot into julienne batons, cut the beetroot into slices, and then cut the slices in half (half circle shapes) to make it easier. Please note that the cook time will increase. Cook until the beetroot is ""al dente"".
Note on deseeding chili peppers - If you're sensitive to spice, then make sure to de-seed the the jalapeno / serrano / green chili peppers. Wear gloves to avoid contact with skin, and always wash your hands before touching anyone else or any other part of your body.

Lower the heat to medium low to low, and let the curry gently simmer (with the lid slightly off) for about 1 - 1 ½ hours. If too much liquid is evaporating while cooking, add some water as needed.
The jackfruit pieces should be nice and soft (check by pricking the “nose” of a jackfruit piece to see how easily it can be pierced with a knife/fork or skewer). Taste and season with salt to taste.
After the curry has simmered and the jackfruit is soft, you can cook the curry uncovered for a few more minutes IF you prefer a thicker curry gravy. If the gravy is too thick for your liking however, add a little water. Always season to taste.

11,"Ingredients:
▢2 – 3 tbsp coconut oil or vegetable oil
▢½ yellow onion diced or sliced
▢4 garlic cloves minced or finely chopped
▢1 inch ginger minced or finely chopped
▢6 – 7 curry leaves or 2 bay leaves
▢2 ½ tbsp roasted Sri Lankan curry powder or unroasted is fine too
▢1 cinnamon stick (preferably Ceylon cinnamon) or ½ tsp ground cinnamon
▢½ tsp salt plus more to taste
▢1 tsp cayenne pepper or kashmiri chili powder less if you like it less spicy, please see recipe notes below
▢1 tbsp paprika NOT smoked paprika
▢2 lbs chicken whole chicken cut into sections OR any bone-in chicken thigh or leg pieces (large thigh pieces should be cut in half)
▢2 serrano peppers (or regular green chili) cut length-wise, with or without seeds
▢3 small roma tomatoes cut into cubes (or 2 medium-sized regular tomatoes)
▢2 tsp brown sugar see recipe notes
▢2 tsp lime juice or apple cider vinegar see recipe notes
▢½ cup full-fat coconut milk see recipe notes
▢½ cup water
Instructions:
Prepare the bone-in chicken by cutting it into smaller pieces. Each piece should be fairly small but not bite-sized. A regular chicken thigh should be cut in half and larger pieces should be cut into 3. A chicken breast should be cut into 3 pieces or more.
The larger the chicken piece, the longer it will take to cook through, so it's important to keep the pieces fairly similar in size.

Add the coconut oil into a large saucepan and heat the oil over medium heat. Add onions and cook until they start to soften.
2 – 3 tbsp coconut oil,½ yellow onion
Add the garlic and ginger to the softened onions, and sauté until the garlic starts to soften. Make sure it doesn't burn.
4 garlic cloves,1 inch ginger

Add curry powder, chili powder / cayenne pepper, paprika, cinnamon, curry leaves, and mix to combine. Cook for a few minutes until you start to smell the spices.
6 – 7 curry leaves,2 ½ tbsp roasted Sri Lankan curry powder,1 cinnamon stick,1 tsp cayenne pepper or kashmiri chili powder,1 tbsp paprika
Add the chicken, serrano peppers / green chili peppers, salt, roma tomatoes, about 1 tsp sugar, and mix to coat. Cook for 10 minutes with the lid off, on medium high heat. Frequently stir to make sure the chicken or the spices don’t burn.
½ tsp salt,2 lbs chicken,2 serrano peppers (or regular green chili),3 small roma tomatoes,2 tsp brown sugar
Add coconut milk, water, lime juice / vinegar, and bring the curry to a boil. If you want less gravy, add less liquid.
½ cup full-fat coconut milk,½ cup water,2 tsp lime juice or apple cider vinegar
Lower the heat and let it simmer with the lid on for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Leave the lid off if you want to reduce the liquid content in the curry.
The chicken should be completely cooked by this point. This will depend on the size of the chicken pieces and the stove you use.
Taste the curry and season with more salt to taste if needed. You can add the rest of the sugar or more salt, or vinegar to your taste. Remember that curries can easily be adjusted to your taste!
If the chicken curry gravy is too thin, or there's too much of it, uncover and simmer the curry for a further 10 minutes or longer. This step is optional, but it allows the water to evaporate and for the gravy to thicken. If you want more gravy, you can add more water or coconut milk, but you will need to adjust the flavor accordingly.
Turn off the heat and let the chicken cool down slightly. Serve with rice or roti.
For best results, store the chicken curry in the fridge overnight and eat it the next day. (Seriously, it tastes even better the next day!)
Tips & Tricks
Recipe notes
NOTE 1 – if you want a less spicy curry, you can reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/4 – 1/2 tsp. If you like an extra spicy curry, you can add up to 2 tsp of cayenne pepper. We like it very spicy, and add up to 2 – 3 tsp of cayenne pepper / Kashmiri chili. Do NOT use Mexican chili powder for this curry. You should be able to find regular chili powder or Kashmiri chili at any Asian grocery store.
NOTE 2 – you can replace the 1/2 cup of coconut milk with water. If you’re not adding coconut milk, this chicken curry will be spicier. The coconut milk softens the heat.
NOTE 3 – if you want the curry to have a thicker gravy, you can reduce the amount of liquid by half.
NOTE 4 – The sugar is added to balance the spices, and bring out the saltiness of the curry. If you’re using a different curry powder, or you’re making curry for the first time, add only half of the sugar initially, and then add the rest of the sugar if you feel like you need it at the end. 
NOTE 5 – If you’re using store-bought curry powder, please make sure the curry powder has a combination of at least some of the spices of my Sri Lankan curry powder. Avoid curry powders that have turmeric, garlic powder, and onion powder as the main ingredients – these are NOT curry powders. 
NOTE 6 – In Sri Lanka, the main type of vinegar that is used is coconut vinegar. This is harder to find, and more expensive in other parts of the world. Lime juice is a great substitute, and apple cider vinegar can also be used. ",Chicken Curry,Curries,Spicy Flavor,10-20,"Lunch,Breakfast,Dinner",Western,Healthy

1 kg (1 1/4lb) small bite sized chicken pieces, skin removed and preferably on the bone
1 tsp black pepper
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp light soy sauce
4 tbsp coconut oil
1 cinnamon stick, broken into small pieces, or cassia left whole
4 cloves
2 cardamon pods, lightly bruised
½ medium red onion, finely chopped
2 green chillies, cut lengthwise
5 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 x 2.5cm (1 inch) ginger, finely chopped
2 small pieces of pandan leaves, about 7.5cm (3 inches) square total
20 curry leaves
½ tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp Chinese chicken powder (optional but it adds a nice flavour)
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions
Place a dry frying pan over a medium heat and stir in the Kashmiri chilli powder and curry powder. Let these spices roast for a few minutes, stirring often until they turn a deep chocolate brown. Transfer the roasted spice powder to a plate and set aside.
Put the chicken in a large mixing bowl and season with the salt, pepper and soy sauce. Be sure to mix these ingredients right into the flesh of the meat. You can now go straight to cooking or leave it to marinate overnight.
When ready to cook, heat the coconut oil in a large wok or pot over a medium-high heat. Add the cinnamon stick, cloves, cardamom pods, chopped onion, chillies, garlic, ginger, pandan leaf and curry leaves and stir it all up.
Continue frying for about 5 minutes or until the onion is just beginning to turn a golden brown and then stir in the ground turmeric and the prepared roasted curry powder and chilli powder blend.
Pour in 250ml (1 cup) water and bring it all to a simmer. Then add the chicken and add a little more water if required. You want the water level to almost but not completely cover the chicken pieces. Add the Chinese chicken powder, if using.
Cover the pan and continue cooking for about 10 minutes, by which time the meat should be just about cooked through.
Then uncover the pan and let it all simmer gently for another 10 minutes or so to thicken the sauce. This is normally a dry curry with a thick sauce and the black sauce should coat the chicken.

Now add the cashews to the hot oil. Be sure to stir continuously so that the cashews brown evening. In Sri Lanka, the cashews are deep fried so that they fry evenly. You can use less oil with this recipe but watch them carefully.
Just before the cashews are finished cooking, stir in the ground turmeric.
Transfer the browned cashews to a bowl lined with a few paper towels. Use the paper towels to soak up any excess oil. Then add the fried curry leaves and garlic, followed by the black pepper, chilli powder and salt to taste.

Instructions
Place the squid in a bowl and cover with the milk. Milk is a natural tenderiser which gives the squid a perfect texture when fried so be sure the squid is completely covered.
Cover the bowl with cling film and place in the fridge overnight to marinate. The milk will turn pink which is natural and fine.
When ready to cook, remove the squid from the milk marinade and discard the milk. Whisk the eggs in a bowl and place the squid in it.
Now mix the two flours on a plate with the salt, pepper and chilli powder. Dust the egg coated squid thoroughly with the flour mixture and shake off any excess flour. Set aside.
Heat about 500ml (2 cups) of oil in a wok and heat to 190°C (375°F) over medium high heat. If you don’t have an oi thermometer, place a wooden chopstick or spatula in the oil. If thousands of little bubbles form and sizzle on contact, your oil is ready to cook.
Cook the squid in small batches until crispy and lightly browned which will take about 1 minute per batch. Do not overcook the squid or it will become chewy.
Transfer the cooked calamari to a paper towel lined plate and set aside. Discard the cooking oil.
Wipe your wok clean and add the butter. Melt the butter over a medium high heat and add the chopped garlic. Swirl the garlic around in the butter for about a minute and then stir in the chilli paste.

2 tsp light brown sugar
2 tbsp distilled white vinegar or coconut vinegar
1 tsp tamarind concentrate
250ml (1 cup) thick coconut milk
Instructions
Place the aubergine pieces in a large mixing bowl and sprinkle with the ground turmeric and salt. Mix well to coat and allow to sit while you heat the oil.
Heat about 5cm (2 inches) of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok until visibly hot and then add the eggplant (aubergine). You should do this in two or more batches to maintain the heat of the oil.
Fry until golden brown and then transfer to paper towels to soak up any excess oil. Fry the shallots in the same way but these should only be lightly browned to soften. Transfer these to paper towels too. You can discard the cooking oil.
Wipe the pan clean and then place it back on a medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil and when it melts stir in the mustard seeds.
When the mustard seeds begin to crackle, reduce the heat to medium and add the cinnamon, cardamom pods, curry leaves and the pandan leaves (if using). Infuse the ingredients into the oil for about 30 seconds and then add the chopped onion. Fry this for about five minutes or until the onion is soft and translucent and then stir in the garlic and ginger paste. Stir in the chillies and fry for 30 seconds and then add the remaining ingredients.
Simmer the sauce for a minute or two and then taste it. It should be a nice combination of sweet, sour and spicy. At this stage you can adjust the flavour to taste by adding more sugar, vinegar or tamarind. If you think it is too spicy, just add more coconut milk.
Once you’re happy with the sauce, pour in the fried aubergines and shallots. Bring up to heat, stirring it all together to combine. Season with salt to taste and serve.",Eggplant Curry,Curries,"Kirata(Using Coconut Milk),Spicy Flavor,Fried",10-20,Lunch,Western,Healthy

1 tsp dry active yeast
70ml (1/4 cup) warm water
1 tbsp sugar
FOR THE BATTER
270g (2 cups) white or brown rice flour
400ml (1 ½ cups) good quality coconut milk
125ml ( ½ cup) coconut water or water
½ tsp salt
½ tsp sugar
Instructions
Pour the warm water into a bowl. It should be hand hot so not boiling but about bath water temperature. Stir in the dry active yeast and sugar and then cover with a towel to retain the heat of the water and place in a warm location for about 15 to 20 minutes. The yeast will wake up and become bubbly.
While the yeast is proving, sift the rice flour into a large mixing bowl and add just enough of the coconut milk to make a soft dough. Cover and let it rise in a warm location for about 4 hours.
After four hours, add the remaining coconut milk and knead it into the dough. Then start adding the coconut water or water slowly. You may not need it all. You just want to have a thick and creamy batter similar to full fat cream. Whisk until there are no lumps in the batter. Your batter is now ready to use but you can make it even better by letting the batter ferment.
To do so, cover the batter tightly and place it in a warm place. I usually place it in my oven with just the pilot light turned on. Leave it to ferment for 24 hours for a stronger, more authentic flavour. Whisk again and set aside.
To cook the hoppers, lightly grease a hopper pan. You just want a film of oil so that the hopper doesn’t stick and greasing the pan is not necessary if you are using a non-stick hopper pan.
Place the pan over a medium-high heat and when hot, add a small ladle full of the batter and swirl it around in the pan. You are aiming for a thin film of batter all over the sides of the pan and more batter at the bottom. This will give you both a fluffy and crispy hopper just like those you find in Sri Lanka.
Cover the pan and cook for about 4 minutes. The sides will turn crispy brown and the bottom of the hopper will be nice and fluffy.
If you are not using a non-stick hopper pan, hit the sides of the pan a few times with the handle of a knife and then use the same knife to ease the hopper out of the pan.
Transfer your cooked hopper to a plate and continue until all the batter is used up or until you have enough to serve. Any leftover batter can be stored in the fridge for at least three days and it can also be frozen for up to six months.",Hopper Recipe,Rice,white Rice/Brown Rice,20+ ,"Lunch,Breakfast,Dinner",Western,Healthy

350 g String hopper Flour (red or white or mix of both)

6 g salt

400 g/ml Luke warm water* (you may need more water depending on how dry the flour is)

1 tsp cooking oil to apply on string hopper trays
Instructions
To a bowl add string hopper flour and salt. Mix a little bit with a wooden spoon or a stick.


Add warm water to the bowl little by little and mix with the wooden stick until you see the flour form into lumps of dough. 


 Some string hopper packets/brands say to use room-temperature water. Nevertheless, I always find I get softer string hoppers and a manageable dough when I use warm water.
Then Mix the dough with your hand into one soft pliable dough. The dough should be a little tacky but not sticky. And when squeeze the dough with your hand, it should not crumble apart or  should not stick to your finger. If the dough is too tough or dry, add a little bit of water and knead again. If the dough is sticky and watery, add a little bit of string hopper flour and knead it.


Lay the string hopper trays on the counter. Apply a very thin coating of oil over the surface of string hopper trays. This prevents the string hoppers from sticking to the trays.


Fill the string hopper maker with dough, up to 80% of its volume, leaving some space on the top. 


Press the string hopper maker and add strings/noodles over the string hopper tray in a circular motion. When the tray is covered with strings, stop pushing the string hopper maker and cut the strings using your finger.


Add strings/noodles to about 10 trays or as many as you can fit in your steamer basket at once. 


I have 20 string hopper trays. But my steamer can only hold 10 trays at once. So I only prep 10 trays at once. When those 10 trays are steaming, I prep the rest of the 10 trays.
Place the string hopper trays in the steamer basket, layering them with minimal overlapping to ensure even steaming. 


Steam them for 5 - 6 minutes or until string hoppers are cooked through. Gently touch the top of the string hopper with a spoon or your finger (be very careful of the steam), it should be firm, springy, and not sticky at all.


Take the string hopper trays out  (you can use a tong for this) and remove the string hoppers from the trays. Stack them in a bowl/container and keep them covered to prevent them from drying out while you make the rest of the string hoppers. Enjoy string hoppers with your favorite side dishes!

To Marinate Salmon

450 g Fresh Salmon, Skin on, Cut into large 3 inch pieces or strips

1⁄2 tsp chili powder or paprika

1⁄2 tsp freshly ground black pepper

1⁄4 tsp salt

1 Small wedge of lime
Other

2 tbsp Avocado oil or other neutral cooking oil

4 large cloves of garlic

1⁄2 Inch piece of ginger

1⁄8 tsp fenugreek seeds

2 Pieces of Ceylon cinnamon, roughly 2 inches long

1 large piece of goraka/garcinia (see the description for substitutes)

1⁄2 cup Onion, finely chopped

1 Sprig of curry leaves

1 Small pandan leaf broken into pieces

1 tsp chili powder or paprika

1 tsp unroasted curry powder (see the description)

1⁄4 tsp turmeric powder

salt to your taste (start with about 1/4 of a tsp. You can adjust after tasting the curry later)

1⁄2 cup thick coconut milk (I use canned)

1 cup water (adjust as how thick or runny you like the curry)

1 lime or lemon to make zest

3 green chilies (optional)
Instructions
Marinate Salmon:
Add the marinating ingredients (chili powder, black pepper, salt and lime) to the salmon pieces. Gently rub the ingredients into the Salmon pieces to coat them. Set it aside and let it marinate for about 30 minutes.


Prepare crushed ginger and garlic:
Meanwhile, Add ginger and garlic into a mortar and pestle. Pound until it becomes a rough paste. If you don't have a mortar and pestle, chop them finely. 


Sear the salmon pieces:
When the salmon is marinated, heat a saute pan or a flat-bottom wok. Add oil. Let the oil heat up very well. Place the salmon pieces on the pan, skin side down. Let them fry for about one minute or until the skin starts to turn golden on the edges. And then carefully flip them using tongs and sear the other side for about another minute. Salmon will still be raw in the middle. Don't worry, we are going to simmer them later in the curry. 


Remove the seared salmon pieces into a clean plate and set them aside.

Sauté the aromatics:
To the same pan/wok, add fenugreek seeds, Ceylon cinnamon sticks, Goraka  (check the description for substitutes), crushed ginger and garlic, curry leaves, pandan leaves, and onion.  Saute until onions start to soften and cook down. 


Add spices:
Lower the heat and add chili powder, curry powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix with the onions and saute for about a minute until the mixture becomes darker in color and aromatic. 


Simmer the sauce:
Add coconut milk and water. Stir well to combine with the spices and aromatics. Let them simmer for about 5 - 8 minutes on low heat. Stir it from time to time. Do NOT cover with a lid, as the coconut milk can boil over. (If you use freshly squeezed coconut milk, just add the water first, simmer for about 5 minutes, and then add the coconut milk and keep stirring for about a minute. fresh coconut milk tends to curdle with heat) You can add more coconut milk/water if the curry reduces too much.


Adding Salmon:
Gently place the salmon pieces in the curry, skin side down. With the help of a spoon, slowly baste the salmon pieces with the curry sauce for about 2 minutes. Please do not touch the salmon pieces too much as they can flake or break into pieces. 


Adding zest and adjusting seasoning
Add lemon or lime zest (I usually use 1/2 of a large lime for 1lb/450g of salmon). Also add the green chilies to the curry. Baste the salmon pieces again to mix the zest with the curry. You can gently shake and turn the pan/wok to move the sauce around. Taste the curry and adjust the seasoning. If the curry tastes bland it usually lacks salt. If the curry is not tangy enough, you can add a few drops of lime/lemon juice when the curry is done cooking (adding lime to coconut milk while it's simmering can make the milk curdle. So it's best to wait until the end to add citrus).  Let the curry simmer for another few minutes in the sauce until the salmon pieces are nice and cooked all the way through and the curry has somewhat thickened.

Sprinkle turmeric powder and gently mix everything. Fry again until eggplant pieces turn somewhat tender. Gently mix from time to time. Do not close the lid as this would make the eggplants steam instead of frying.

Then add the salt, garlic, curry leaves, onion, green chilies, chili flakes, and Maldive fish chips. Mix everything well. 

I usually break the curry leaves in half before adding.
Cover and cook until onions are wilted and eggplants are soft. Taste and adjust salt as needed. If too much liquid accumulates in the pan, remove the cover.

50 g Cashews cut into pieces

55 g Butter, cut into cubes (55g equals to 4tbsp or half a stick)

3 large eggs

1 tsp Vanilla extract
To butter the baking pan

1 tbsp Butter
Instructions
Make the date pulp
Chop the pitted dates into small pieces and add them to a heat-proof small bowl or a cup. Pour the hot tea over it and let them soak for about 20 minutes. 


You can continue to the next steps while the dates are soaking. Tea helps to make the cake turn darker in color. You can substitute tea with hot water or milk as well.
After 20 minutes, mash them into a paste using a spoon or with your fingers. Keep it aside to cool down.


Make the Spice mix
Add cardamom and cloves to a mortar and pestle. Pound them until the cardamom seeds and cloves turn into a fine powder. Pick and discard the cardamom shells. Keep it aside. 


Sieve the flour mix
Into a bowl, sieve all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Give a quick mix. Keep it aside. 


You can also do this step while the coconut and treacle mixture / pol pani mix cools down (in the next step) to save time
Make Pol Pani (coconut treacle mix)
Reserve 3 tbsp treacle for later to brush on the cake. Add the rest of the treacle to a large deep pan. Turn on the heat and bring the treacle to a simmer. Add the spice mix you made and the grated coconut. Mix and cook until the mixture starts to thicken up. Keep it in medium heat. Continue stirring to stop the syrup from burning and to speed up the thickening process.


Mix the add-ons
When the coconut-treacle mixture thickened up, turn off the heat. Add mashed dates, 2/3 of the cashews (keep the rest to sprinkle on top of the cake), and Butter. Mix well until the butter is melted and the mixture is well combined. Let the mixture cools down to room temperature. 


Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F/175c for at least 20 minutes. Butter an 8-inch * 8-inch cake pan. Line the cake pan with parchment paper and apply butter again. Make sure to leave a small flap of parchment paper so it's easier to lift the cake when it's baked.


When the coconut mixture is cooled down, add the eggs and vanilla. Mix well until you don't see any unmixed egg yolks or whites. 


It's very important that the mixture and the pan has cooled down before you add eggs to stop the eggs from coagulating/cooking.
Then add the flour mixture, a little by little, to the coconut mixture. Gently mix with the spoon until no flour lumps are left. Do not over mix as it can affect the texture of the cake.


Transfer the mixture to a baking tray. Tap on the counter to remove any air bubbles.


Sprinkle the rest of the cashews on the top.


Bake the cake in the preheated oven for 35 - 45 minutes or until the middle is not jiggly and when you insert a toothpick into the middle, it shouldn't come out with wet batter. 

Let the cake bake for at least 35 minutes, undisturbed without opening the oven door. Sudden drop of oven temperature can make the middle of the cake to sink.
When the timer is up, take the cake out. Brush the cake with the rest of the treacle. Bake it again for another 5 minutes.


After 5 minutes, take the cake out of the baking tray to stop it from baking any further. Cool it down on a cooling rack.

You can serve it now or it will taste even better the next day. Store the cake in a sealed container, wrapped with plastic wrap and it will last about 4 - 5 days without refrigeration. ",Sri Lankan Coconut Cake,Dessert,Dessert,20+ ,Dines,Western,Healthy

Cut mangoes in half (cut the seeds and the seed-shell as well). Discard the seed which is inside the seed-shell. Cut each half into 2 - 4 pieces depending on the size of the mangoes.  Add salt, turmeric powder and black pepper powder and mix well. Let the mango pieces marinate until you prepare other ingredients.


The seed shell helps to keep the flesh intact otherwise the curry can turn mushy.


optional step
Add cloves, cardamom, and Maldive fish chips to the mortar and pestle. Crush them until there aren't any large chunks left. 

You can make the spices into a powder too or leave them whole. I like to crush them a little bit so I don't bite into large chunks of spices or hard Maldive fish chips. Also the powdered spices are stronger than whole spices.
Making the Curry
Heat a large clay pot or a heavy bottom pot or a saucepan. Add oil and let the oil heat up. Add cinnamon, onion, garlic, curry leaves and pandan leaves. Saute. When garlic onion start to turn translucent, add the crushed spices and Maldive fish chips. Saute until garlic and onions turn brown. 


Lower the heat. Add chili powder, roasted curry powder, and salt. Saute until the curry powder and chili powder starts to turn dark brown. 


Adding a little bit of salt along with chili powder reduces the amount of smoke it produces.
Add the mango pieces. Mix well with all the ingredients that are in the pot.


Add water. Turn the heat to medium. Cook uncovered until water starts to simmer.


When the water starts to simmer, lower the heat to medium to low, cover the pot with a lid, and cook for about 45 minutes - 1 hour until mango pieces are soft and tender. Add some water if you feel like the pot is drying out while cooking.

When mango pieces are fully cooked and tender, add sugar and mix well. Taste and adjust salt if needed. 


Cook the curry uncovered until you get the desired thickness of gravy. Mango curry will turn darker in color as you cook it down.

20 g Sugar

20 g Butter

7 g Rapid rise yeast/fast acting yeast (if you're using active dry yeast make sure to activate it. see notes.)

10 g salt
For the oil flour mix

10 g bread flour

10 g coconut oil/vegetable oil (slightly warm if the oil is still in solid from)
To toast the bread

1⁄2 a stick of butter
Instructions
Making the dough
Into the bowl of your stand mixer, warm milk, warm water, and instant yeast. Let it sit for a minute or two to see if the yeast forms tiny bubbles on the edges. Instant yeast doesn't need to be activated but this way you can confirm your yeast is good.

If you're using active dry yeast, make sure to add the yeast to the warm milk and water mixture with a little bit of sugar and let it sit for about 10 minutes until yeast the mixture is nice and foamy. (don't add all the sugar as too much sugar can actually kill/slow down yeast)
Add butter, flour, and sugar—Knead to the mixer for 10 minutes. If kneading by hand, knead for about 20 minutes until the dough is very stretchy, soft, and pliable. 

Take the dough out of the mixer bowl, and shape it into a ball. Place it on the counter, cover it with a bowl, and let it double in size. This would take roughly an hour to 1.5 hours depending on your room temperature. Focus on the size of the dough rather than time.

When the dough has doubled in size, divide it into three equal pieces. Shape each dough piece into a ball. Cover the dough balls and let them rest for about 20 - 30 minutes.

Make the flour-oil mixture
Into a small cup/bowl, add oil and flour and mix it very well. Keep it aside. 

Shape the dough into Thati Paan
Take one dough ball out. Flatten it out using your hands or a rolling pin into a rectangle. The width should be roughly equal to the width of your bread pan.Use your bread pan as a guideline.

Roll the rectangular dough from top to bottom, into a log. Pinch the ends to seal the edges.  Also, cover the inside of the loaf pans with butter or oil

Flatten the dough a little bit with your palms. Transfer the dough to the loaf pan, seam side down, and push it to one side. Apply the oil-flour mixture on the visible side so it's easier to separate bread.

Repeat the process for the other two dough balls as well. Make sure to apply the oil-flour mixture between each dough so they don't stick together. (please watch the video)

Second Rise
Cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and let it rise again until the dough has doubled in size. This would take roughly an hour - 1.5 hours depending on room temperature. Focus on the size of the dough, not the clock. Meanwhile make sure to preheat the oven to 400F/ 200C for about 20 mins.

Baking and Broiling
When they have properly risen, spray (or brush if you don’t have a spray) some water on the top of the bread. This will help the bread to rise better in the oven and make the top crusty.

Bake them in the oven for about 30 - 40 mins. This time varies from oven to oven. If you’re using a smaller convectional oven there is a chance that your bread browns quicker. Check on your bread after about 20 mins. If they seem to brown too quickly, transfer them to a lower rack and reduce the temperature a little bit or cover it with a piece of foil.

Separate each Thati paan carefully and lay them on a baking sheet. Turn on the broiler setting in the oven. Apply melted/softened butter or coconut oil on one side first. Then broil for about a minute or two until they get nice and brown. Keep watching as you broil them cause they can go from toasted to burnt very quickly.

Then turn the other side. Apply butter or coconut oil and broil again until nice and brown. Let the bread cool down on a cooling rack for a while before you cut them. So the crumbs can settle in.",Whole Wheat Sri Lankan Thati Paan,Snacks,Fried,20+ ,"Breakfast,Dinner",Western,Healthy

after 2 hours, grind the mustard in the mortar and pestle until it's creamy. You can use a small grinder for this as well. But I notice that they become creamier when you do it in mortar and pestle.


Into your blender, add the dates along with the vinegar that you used to soak them earlier, garlic, ginger, chili powder, cinnamon powder, and 1 tsp of salt. (you can adjust the salt later)*

Blend it until the mixture is smooth and doesn't have any solid pieces.


some people also like to add a small piece of lime pickle (lunu dehi) when making this sauce. I usually omit this. You can add if you like the taste.
Add the blended mixture to a large clay pot or to a Dutch oven. Also, add ground mustard seeds and dark brown sugar. Mix and taste. Add the rest of the vinegar and salt, little by little, to balance the sweetness of the mixture. If the sauce is too sweet, add a little vinegar; if you got it too vinegary, add a little bit of brown sugar. 

Bring the sauce to a simmer or until it bubbles slowly on the surface. Turn off the heat and let it cool down for about 5 - 10 minutes.


Some people like to skip the cooking part and directly mix the vegetables with blended sauce. This way you can preserve the color of vegetables a little bit better. But heating the sauce makes the raw garlic and ginger flavor goes away and flavors meld better together. Either way is fine.
Mix carrots, shallots, banana peppers, green chilies and chopped dates with the sauce.


Let it cool down. Cover and let it sit overnight for the vegetables to soften and for flavors to develop. The next day you'd see that vegetables have oozed out more liquid and that your sauce has thinned out. This is totally fine. Give it a good mix before you serve. Store leftovers in a sterile jar.

20 g seedless tamarind

3 tbsp warm water

1 kg Onions* (1kg = a little over 2 pounds = about 5 yellow onions)

1⁄4 cup Coconut Oil (or any neutral oil)

6 pieces of cinnamon (3 inch long each)

10 Cardamom pods

6 cloves

2 large sprigs of curry leaves

1 small pandan leaf broken into pieces

1 tbsp chili flakes

1⁄2 tbsp chili powder

1 tsp turmeric powder

1 1⁄2 tsp Salt (adjust to your taste)

1 tbsp Sugar (adjust to your taste)
Instructions
Add tamarind and warm water into a small bowl. Set it aside to soak.

Thinly slice onions. Add them to a large mixing bowl. Add chili flakes, chili powder, and turmeric powder to the bowl. Mix well with onions.

Squeeze tamarind in warm water using your fingers to make it a thick saucy pulp. Discard any seeds and skin.

Heat a large saute pan or a wok and add oil to it. When the oil starts to heat up, add cinnamon sticks, cardamom, and cloves. Let them heat in oil for a few seconds. Then add curry leaves and pandan leaves. (Be careful. Curry leaves and pandan leaves splatter in oil. You can close the pan with a lid for a few seconds for this)

Add onions and saute until onions become wilted. Then add salt, mix, and cook until there's no moisture left in the pan. Mix from time to time to avoid the bottom layer of onions from burning.

Add tamarind pulp. Mix well with onions. Cook on medium-low heat, uncovered until onions are jammy in texture and some onion slices are caramelized.

Add sugar. Start with a little bit and increase until the onions are not sour in taste. Sourness should be balanced with sweetness. If the Seeni sambol is too sour, add more sugar. If it's too sweet, add a little bit of tamarind. Also adjust salt if needed.

Saute and cook until the onions are darker in color and jammy in texture. You can stop the cooking process at any point you like. More moisture you remove from the onions more time it'd last without going bad.

1⁄8 tsp fenugreek seeds

2 pieces of ceylon cinnamon (about 2 inches long each)

1⁄4 tsp turmeric powder (add more if you like the curry more yellow)

1 tsp curry powder (I use Sri Lankan unroasted curry powder)

1 1⁄2 cup diluted coconut milk (1 part canned coconut milk + 3 parts water)

1⁄3 cup thick coconut milk (directly from the can without diluting)

5 curry leaves to add at the end (optional, for aroma)
optional

a few drops of lime juice (see notes)
Instructions
Cut green beans into long (2 inch roughly) slices. Cut the potatoes into thin slices as well. They both should have roughly the same thickness. 

Add everything into a deep pot except for a few curry leaves and, thick coconut milk. Mix well.

Put on the stove and cook on medium heat until coconut milk starts to simmer. 

Then turn the heat to low. Put the lid on the top of the pot but leave some space so the steam can escape. Cook until potatoes are about 90% cooked. Make sure to mix from time to time to stop the curry from bubbling and spilling over.

Then add thick coconut milk, curry leaves (break them to release more aroma) and mix gently with everything else. Once the curry starts to simmer, turn off the heat.

Heat a soup pot and add butter into it. Keep the heat medium. Add garlic and and curry leaves. Sauté until garlic turns soft. (curry leaves splatter when added to hot butter. be careful)

Add carrot, leeks, celery and cabbage (sliced green bean is also a common vegetable that you can add). Also add salt (do not add too much as many broths contain salt). Sauté until leeks turns wilted and soft. 

Then add potatoes, tomatoes and red lentils. Sauté for about a minute. Add the broth. Mix everything. Cover and simmer until all the potatoes are fully cooked and mashable. Turn off the heat.

Now using an emersion blender, blend the soup until about half of the vegetable pieces are blended*. (Or you can transfer half of the soup to a regular blender and blend it)

Turn the heat back on and bring the soup to simmer. Add noodles. Cook until noodles are about 80% cooked (it will continue to cook with the residual heat). Add black pepper and turn off the heat. Adjust salt if necessary.

1 cup julienned or grated carrot

1⁄2 cup thinly sliced green beans

1 cup thinly sliced leeks

salt to your taste
Other

2 tsp lime juice (lemon pepper seasoning works too)

salt to sprinkle chicken with (to your taste)

oil spray (I use avocado oil)

1⁄3 cup fried/toasted cashews for garnishing
Instructions
Add cardamom pods* and cloves into the mortar and pestle. Crush them until they become a coarse powder. Remove cardamom shells if necessary. Add ginger and garlic cloves. Crush them into a rough paste. (do not make it into a smooth paste. It can burn quickly in the instant pot)


Turn on the saute mode in your instant pot, and set the temperature to medium. Heat butter. Add cinnamon stick, whole black peppercorns, curry leaves, and pandan leaves. Saute for a few seconds. Then add onions. Cook onions until they become sweaty. Then add the ginger garlic spice paste you just made. Saute until they become light brown on the edges. (add a touch of water if you feel like the mixture is sticking too much to the pot)


Then add turmeric powder and salt (you get the chance to adjust the salt in a later step). Add chicken pieces in. Saute for about 30 seconds. 


Add water. Cover the pot. Pressure cook on high pressure for 8 mins. (Turn on the pressure cook mode. Select high pressure and adjust the timer to 8 mins and press start.)


When the timer is up, let the pressure release naturally. Open the lid. Remove chicken pieces to a separate plate using tongs.


Add washed-drained rice and coconut milk to the instant pot. Mix. Taste the broth and it should taste salty. if not add a little bit more salt. Close the lid and press the ""rice"" button or pressure cook on low pressure for 12 minutes.


Stir-frying vegetables and mixing with rice
Do these steps while the rice is cooking.
Meanwhile, heat butter in a frying pan or a small wok. When butter is melted add carrot and green beans. When they become tender, turn off the heat. Add leeks and salt to your taste. Saute. The residual heat is enough to cook leeks.


When the rice is done, let the pressure release naturally. Add the vegetable stir-fry to the instant pot. Mix everything gently without breaking the rice grains. 


Air-frying chicken
Pre-heat the air-fryer to 400F for about 6 mins. 

Sprinkle salt and add lime juice over both sides of the chicken (You can also add black pepper and chili powder to your taste if you like the chicken spicy). Place them in the air-fryer basket. Cook for 3 - 5 mins, 400F until the skin is brown.


Garnish rice with roasted/fried cashews (fried onions are also a very good addition). Serve warm.

Make the Beef Curry
Into your pressure cooker (can use an instant pot) add all the curry ingredients listed, except water. Which are beef cubes, onion, green chili, garlic, ginger, curry leaves, pandan leaves, cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon, cumin powder, curry powder, paprika/chili powder, turmeric powder, salt and oil. Mix well with a spoon to coat all the beef pieces with spices and oil. 


Turn on the stove and saute for about 5 mins until the onions turn translucent, and liquid starts to ooze out from the beef pieces. *


Add 1 cup of water (add more if you like more gravy), mix everything and cover with the lid. Pressure cook on medium heat for 6 whistles in a traditional pressure cooker. Or 35mins in an instant pot on high pressure. 


After 6 whistles, let the pressure goes down naturally. Take about a cup of meat pieces out(without any liquid), let them cool down a little bit, and shred them into pieces using two forks. In case your meat is not tender enough* to shred, add about 1/4 cup of water and pressure cook for another one-two whistle or 6-10 mins in the instant pot on high pressure.


Prepping Roti/flatbread pieces
Thaw frozen Ceylon parotta/Godamba roti according to package instructions. (I usually follow the microwave method). Unfold them to seperate the layers. Cut them into small square pieces, around 3/4 inch in length. Doesn't have to be uniform.


Now heat the wok or a frying pan. Add roti pieces and stir-fry for about a minute until they are not sticky and wet, roti pieces have separated from each other and some pieces catch some golden brown color*. If you're using freshly made godamba roti or dry roti pieces, you can skip this step. 


Making Kottu
Cut your vegetables.  Ready your aromatics, spices, eggs, roti pieces, and shredded beef and curry in separate containers. The process goes quickly so have them all ready, prepped, and closer to your stove.


Heat butter in a wok or a fry pan. Add garlic, curry leaves, pandan leaves. Give a quick toss. Mix in carrots. Stir-fry until carrots turn tender.


Then add shredded beef and onions. Let the beef pieces fry in butter and catch some fried golden color on the edges. Some of the carrots will turn golden as well and that's good.


Then add chili flakes, green chilies, and leeks. Saute for about 10 seconds. 


Move them all to one side of the pan. Add about a tsp of butter to the other side. Add the eggs over butter and start scrambling them until they are halfway cooked. 


When eggs are halfway cooked and half runny, add the roti pieces over the eggs and mix well. This way eggs stick to the roti pieces better since they're still runny. 


Now add oyster sauce and saute really well. Taste and adjust the amount of oyster sauce to your likings.


Add the beef curry about 1/2 cup at a time and mix well. Adjust the amount of curry to your need. I usually add a cup of curry for 450g of roti pieces. 


Adjust salt if needed. Serve warm with the remaining beef curry.


Notes
some meat takes longer to become tender and some don't. It depends on the cut of the meat you're using, the size of your meat pieces, and the time you cook. So if the meat is not shreddable, add a little bit more liquid and pressure cook again for 1 - 2 whistles in the traditional pressure cooker or 6 - 10 mins high pressure in the instant pot.
I usually dry out my roti pieces after I cut them. I always find frozen godamba roti pieces are quite moist and easily breakable when I thaw them. Drying them on a pan helps them to mix with other ingredients without becoming lumpy and absorb more curry which makes them more flavorful. 
some people like the kottu wet and some like it dry and then served with curry. I like the kottu wet when I'm serving it right away. If I'm going to serve it later I keep it dry and serve it with some chicken or beef gravy to add on. If you make a wet kottu to serve later, what happens is, that the roti pieces will absorb all the liquid and will make it lumpy.",Sri Lankan Beef Kottu,Snacks,Spicy Flavour,20+ ,"Lunch,Breakfast,Dinner",Western,Healthy

Clean and cut off the hard tip of the stem. cut okra into about 1/2 cm diagonal slices. This will allow the okra to expose to more heat and cook quicker.


Heat coconut oil in a large nonstick skillet. Add the pieces of cinnamon first. Then add curry leaves, pandan leaves. When they splatter add your finely chopped garlic and saute. 


When the garlic starts to get brown, add sliced onion. Reduce the heat and saute until they start to get translucent. 


Now add turmeric powder, chili flakes, coarse ground black pepper powder, and a little more than half a tsp of salt. You can add more salt later.

(please adjust the amount of chili flakes you use to your preference.)


Saute for about 30 seconds. Mix your spices well with the onions.


Turn up the heat to medium high and add okra. Mix really well. 


Now spread your okra across the whole pan and let them fry a little bit without mixing. When the bottom pieces start to turn golden a little bit, give them a quick toss. Do the same process again once more. You don't need all the pieces to turn brown or golden but those caramelized okra and onion pieces add so much flavor to the stir-fry.


Add white vinegar and mix it well with okra. This will help to reduce the sliminess and will balance out the sweetness from caramelized okra and onions.

2 tsp Salt
Instructions
Making Kiribath
Wash your rice first, then drain water and put it into the rice cooker or instant pot (which is what I use here) or any pot you cook your rice usually. 


Add water and 1 tsp salt (keep rest of the salt for after). Cook your rice using your usual method. If you're using a rice cooker, turn on the cook switch. If you're using an instant pot, press the rice preset. All you do here is cook rice the normal way but with just a little bit of water than you’d normally use.


Get your thick coconut milk (I use one 400ml can for 2 cups of rice) and the rest of the salt to it and dissolve well. Taste it and it should taste a little salty. If you have tasted Kiribath before your coconut milk should have a similar taste to Kiribath now. Adjust salt to your liking. 


Add the coconut milk to the cooked rice as soon as the rice is done cooking. Do NOT wait until the rice cools down.


Mix your rice and coconut milk very well using a spoon until the rice grains breakdown and everything sticks together. You can transfer the rice to a banana leaf or a tray at this point and shape it. But if you still get the raw coconut milk smell, turn on the heat back again and cook for about 2- 3 more minutes on the stove or in the rice cooker. If you’re using an instant pot, press the “Keep warm” option and leave it covered for about 5 - 8 mins


Shaping and cutting Kiribath
Transfer the rice to a cleaned banana leaf. Make sure to do it while Kiribath/milkrice is still hot. It starts to become hardened as it cools down. Which makes it harder to shape and cut into squares.


Shape the Kiribath using another piece of banana leaf/ a baking paper/ spatula into a flat round or a square or to any other shape of your liking. Press the rice firmly so the broken rice sticks to each other.


Get a knife and wrap the knife with a plastic wrap. And apply a little bit of coconut milk/milk or water so the knife doesn’t stick to the rice.


Cut your shaped Kiribath into squares or diamond shapes. Let it cool down a little bit. It’s easier to separate squares when Kiribath has cooled down.

270g ice cubes

1. Prepare the jelly according to the instructions on the packet and set aside to cool to room temperature. Line a rectangular container (measuring approximately 12 x 20cm) with plastic wrap, leaving some plastic wrap hanging over the sides. Pour the jelly into the lined container, then place in the refrigerator to set.

2. Soak the basil seeds in 500ml cold water for 15 minutes, or until soft and plump. While the seeds are soaking, bring 500ml water to the boil in a saucepan, add the vermicelli noodles and cook for 2–3 minutes, or until tender. Drain, rinse under cold running water to stop the cooking process, then drain and set aside.

3. Bring the milk to the boil in a large heavy-based saucepan. Stir in the sugar, then reduce the heat and simmer over low heat for 2–3 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and stir in the rose syrup, and set aside to cool slightly.

4. Drain the basil seeds and add to the faluda, followed by the vermicelli noodles. Transfer to a large jug or container and chill in the refrigerator.

5. When the faluda is chilled, carefully remove the jelly from the container and cut into 2cm cubes. Take six tall glasses and fill each one halfway with the jelly and ice cubes, then pour over the faluda. Serve as a drink or dessert.",Faluda,Drinks,"Cold,Shakes",1-10,Dines,Western,Healthy
